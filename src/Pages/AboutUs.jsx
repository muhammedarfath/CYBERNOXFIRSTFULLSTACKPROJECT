                WaytoNikah.com is a premium matrimonial website for global
                Muslims. Our aim is to help Muslims to find their suitable life
                partner in an Islamic way. We do not support anything that's not
                Halal in Islam so WaytoNikah.com is not a dating portal at all.

                are allowed to register at WaytoNikah.com.
